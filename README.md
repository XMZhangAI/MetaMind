MetaMind is a novel multi-agent framework designed to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) with more human-like social reasoning capabilities. Traditional LLMs often struggle with the ambiguity and indirectness inherent in real-world human communication, failing to grasp unspoken intents, implied emotions, or culturally sensitive cues. MetaMind addresses this gap by explicitly modeling the multi-stage cognitive processes humans use to reason about unobservable mental states and navigate socially complex environments.

Inspired by psychological theories of metacognition and Theory of Mind (ToM), MetaMind employs a staged and collaborative system of three specialized agents and user modeling algorithm to interpret, refine, and respond to social interactions with greater nuance, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. Notbly, metacognition is an awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes, mirrors by planning on declarative knowledge, monitoring procedural knowledge, and evaluating conditional knowledge to adapte its understanding in light of social norms and constraints.

## Key Features & Core Concepts

![Screenshot 2025-05-23 at 10 18 59](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ae5437a-d014-4ebb-ad0d-63b4fff1818f)

MetaMind's architecture is built upon a layered reasoning process involving three distinct agents:

1.  **Theory-of-Mind (ToM) Agent**: This agent initiates the reasoning process by generating multiple hypotheses about the user's latent mental state (beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, thoughts) based on contextual and social cues. It aims to move beyond literal interpretations to infer what the speaker might be truly trying to convey.
    *   **Hypothesis Generation**: Produces a set of candidate mental state interpretations with explanations and type labels.
    *   **Mental-State Reasoning**: Involves commonsense-based hypothesis generation, cross-referencing with social memory, identifying ToM markers, and diversifying hypotheses.

2.  **Domain Agent**: This agent refines the hypotheses generated by the ToM Agent by incorporating socially grounded constraints. It assesses the appropriateness of interpretations against broader norms like cultural expectations, ethical guidelines, and situational context, ensuring socially responsible and domain-aware reasoning.
    *   **Hypothesis Refinement and Selection**: Revises hypotheses based on domain rules (cultural, ethical, role-based) and selects the most appropriate one using a scoring mechanism that balances contextual plausibility and information gain.

3.  **Response Agent**: This agent generates a contextually appropriate output based on the refined optimal hypothesis and the user's social memory (e.g., emotional patterns, prior preferences). It also includes a self-validation mechanism to ensure the response aligns with the inferred intent and maintains social and semantic quality.
    *   **Generation and Validation**: Produces a natural language response conditioned on the selected hypothesis and social memory, then validates it for empathy and coherence.

**Social Memory** is a dynamic, structured knowledge base that evolves across interactions to capture long-term user patterns, social norms, and feedback-based adjustments. It is designed around three core principles: (1) Grounding in context: Memory is initialized based on the situation and roles involved in the interaction. (2) Updating through user modeling: Updating memory via validated long-term interpretations of user mental states. (3) Improving through feedback: It incorporates signals from failures or corrections to better guide future responses.

## Evaluations



## Running the Project [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-Project-blue)](https://mem0.ai/research)

Follow these steps to get MetaMind up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the MetaMind repository to your local system using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your Git repository
cd MetaMind
```

### 2. Setup and Configuration

It's recommended to set up a virtual environment for Python projects.

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure the project by editing the `config.py`file. This file likely contains settings for API keys, model parameters, or other essential configurations. Please refer to the comments within `config.py` for specific instructions on what to set.

### 3. Running the Terminal Version

To run the terminal-based version of MetaMind, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will typically start an interactive command-line interface where you can interact with the MetaMind agents.

### 4. Running the Web Version

To run the web-based interface for MetaMind (if available), execute the `app.py` script:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will usually start a local web server. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal output (commonly `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or similar).
